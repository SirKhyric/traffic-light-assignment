# Traffic Light Project

I developed a traffic light simulator using React by implementing both functional and class components. The simulator dynamically switches between traffic light colors based on user input, demonstrating an understanding of state management and component-based design in React.
  ~ Implemented state management: useState for functional components, this.setState for class components
  ~ Utilized dynamic rendering to toggle traffic light colors based on the current state
  ~ Applied conditional CSS classes to visually represent active traffic light states
  ~ Enhanced reusability by passing a color array as props to control the traffic light sequence  

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
